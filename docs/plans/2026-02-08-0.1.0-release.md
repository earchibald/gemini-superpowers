# 0.1.0 Release Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Release `gemini-superpowers` version 0.1.0 with comprehensive documentation, including a cheatsheet, updated pricing model information relevant to Gemini, and proper attribution, ensuring structural parity with `vsc-superpowers` where applicable.

**Architecture:** The project will follow a standard documentation structure within a `docs` directory at the root of the repository. Documentation will be in Markdown format. Changes will be made to existing `README.md` and `install-superpowers.sh` to reflect release readiness and proper attribution.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown, Shell Scripting (bash).

### Task 1: Create `docs` Directory and Initial Documentation Files

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/README.md`
- Create: `docs/cheatsheet.md`

**Step 1: Write the failing test (conceptual)**
The "test" here is the absence of these files. The goal is to create them.

**Step 2: Create `docs/README.md`**
This file will serve as the main entry point for the documentation. It will provide an overview of `gemini-superpowers`, its purpose, and how it relates to the original Superpowers framework.

```markdown
# Gemini Superpowers Documentation

## Overview

Gemini Superpowers adapts the powerful [Superpowers framework](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) for use with Google Gemini CLI. This project provides a set of tools and configurations to enable an autonomous agent workflow within your Gemini CLI environment, fostering a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, systematic debugging, and comprehensive planning.

## How it Works

The `install-superpowers.sh` script sets up your Gemini CLI environment by:
1. Cloning the core Superpowers skills to a local cache.
2. Generating native Gemini CLI slash commands (`.toml` files) that point to these skills.
3. Injecting a "Loop of Autonomy" protocol into your `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` to guide Gemini CLI's behavior.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Agent Workflow:** Leverage the Superpowers protocol for structured, iterative development.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** Access specialized commands for planning, TDD, debugging, and more.
- **Seamless Integration:** Designed to work natively with Gemini CLI's command system.

## Getting Started

Refer to the main `README.md` for installation instructions. Once installed, explore the available commands using `/superpowers` or consult the [Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.md).

## Cost Model (Gemini Specific)

(This section will be expanded upon in a later task after investigation)
```

**Step 3: Create `docs/cheatsheet.md`**
This file will list all available slash commands with their descriptions and provide examples. I will reuse the `SKILLS` array from `install-superpowers.sh` to generate this content.

```markdown
# Gemini Superpowers Cheatsheet

This cheatsheet provides a quick reference for all available Gemini Superpowers slash commands.

## Available Commands

- `/plan`: Create a detailed implementation plan.
- `/execute`: Execute an implementation plan task-by-task.
- `/brainstorm`: Refine ideas through Socratic dialogue.
- `/tdd`: Implement code using strict Red-Green-Refactor.
- `/investigate`: Perform systematic root-cause analysis.
- `/verify`: Verify fixes before signing off.
- `/worktree`: Create isolated git worktree for features.
- `/finish`: Merge, PR, or discard current branch.
- `/review`: Request a self-correction code review.
- `/receive`: Respond to code review feedback.
- `/subagent`: Dispatch subagents for rapid development.
- `/dispatch`: Run parallel subagent workflows.
- `/newskill`: Create a new Superpowers skill.
- `/superpowers`: Learn about available Superpowers.

## Usage Examples

- To create a new plan: `/plan "Implement user authentication"`
- To start Test-Driven Development: `/tdd "Add a new API endpoint for user profiles"`
- To investigate a failing test: `/investigate "Test 'user_login_fails' is red"`
```

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/README.md docs/cheatsheet.md
git commit -m "feat: Add initial documentation and cheatsheet"
```

### Task 2: Investigate Gemini Cost Model and Update Documentation

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/README.md` (specifically the "Cost Model" section)

**Step 1: Investigate Gemini pricing and Superpowers impact**

```bash
# Conceptual investigation: This step involves external research using google_web_search.
# The agent will need to summarize findings regarding:
# - Gemini API pricing structure (tokens per request, cost tiers)
# - How the Superpowers framework (e.g., detailed plans, iterative steps, subagent calls)
#   might influence token usage compared to unstructured prompting.
# - Provide a concise summary for the docs.
```
*Expected Output:* A summary of Gemini API pricing and how structured prompting/iterations from Superpowers might affect token consumption, ideally with advice on cost optimization.

**Step 2: Update `docs/README.md` with cost model information**
Based on the investigation, populate the "Cost Model (Gemini Specific)" section in `docs/README.md`.

```markdown
# Gemini Superpowers Documentation

... (previous content) ...

## Cost Model (Gemini Specific)

Understanding the cost implications of using Gemini Superpowers is crucial. Gemini's pricing is primarily based on token usage for both input (prompts) and output (responses). The Superpowers framework, with its emphasis on structured prompts, iterative development, and subagent delegation, can influence your Gemini API costs in several ways:

- **Structured Prompting:** While Superpowers encourages more detailed and structured prompts (e.g., comprehensive plans, detailed TDD steps), this can lead to higher input token counts per interaction. However, these structured prompts aim to reduce the need for multiple clarifying interactions, potentially leading to a more efficient overall process.
- **Iterative Development:** The Red-Green-Refactor cycle and systematic debugging often involve several turns of small, focused interactions. Each turn consumes tokens. The efficiency gained from a structured approach can offset the token cost of multiple turns by reducing overall time to resolution and minimizing irrelevant responses.
- **Subagent Usage:** When subagents are dispatched, they operate within their own context, which can increase the total token usage across multiple concurrent or sequential tasks. Monitoring subagent interactions will be important for cost management.

**Recommendations for Cost Optimization:**
- **Be Concise:** While structuring prompts, aim for clarity and conciseness to avoid unnecessary token consumption.
- **Leverage Context:** The Superpowers protocol encourages maintaining context through `plan.md` and `scratchpad.md`, which can help reduce redundant information in prompts.
- **Monitor Usage:** Regularly review your Gemini API usage to understand cost patterns and identify areas for optimization.

By promoting efficient workflows and focused interactions, Gemini Superpowers aims to provide significant value, but users should be mindful of token usage, especially with complex tasks and extensive subagent use.

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/README.md
git commit -m "docs: Add Gemini-specific cost model to documentation"
```

### Task 3: Ensure Credits for Jesse Vincent/obra

**Files:**
- Modify: `README.md`

**Step 1: Add explicit credits to the main `README.md`**
The current `README.md` for `gemini-superpowers` does not explicitly credit Jesse Vincent/obra, although it uses their `obra/superpowers` repository. It's crucial to add this.

Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/2026-02-08-0.1.0-release.md`. Two execution options:

**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

Which approach?
